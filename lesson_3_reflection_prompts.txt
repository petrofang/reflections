When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    this way you can collaborate or use multiple computers. it also acts as a backup
    in case of major disaster

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	someone else working on a GitHub project might edit something out from under you or make some other commit that is disruptive to the commit you were trying to work on. In this case you might want to fork a new branch, and perhaps merge it in after other subsequent edits to the master (origin) branch. 
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	fork only refers to when you clone a github repository into another github repository. clone is when you copy a repository (and its associated metadata) with git (eg) [git clone]. a branch is neither a fork nor a clone. I did say "fork a branch" earlier and I was using the incorrect nomenclature. a branch is part of the same repository as its master; thus a fork or a clone would include all branches.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
