How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

it  filtered out the lines that were irrelevant because they had not changed from version to version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You might remember something that you were trying to do earlier but failed and removed.. 
	a module or class you deleted earlier might be handy later

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    whoa.. I hadn't considered that.. I guess it is/was kind of weird how Docs pretty much saves your file constantly, which is really what you should do.. back in the 90s we'd have to deal with losing a doc after hours and hours of writing because the power went out or the computer crashed or something stupid.. so Pros to auto-save function.. However, you might not want to have every little line change updated in the version system, for instance if you want to make sure that the VC contains code of a certain quality, eg with complete functions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because the files are often related to each other, eg android studio layout XML and code java.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by... typing it into the command line?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	it is easy to roll back if break something, so just go for it!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Java-wrapped NEM API for Android Studio.. going to make a NEM android app.
